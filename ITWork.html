     <h1> IT Work </h1>
   </div><br>

     <h3>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?  </h3>
     <p>Sarah works as a cyber security analyst. She’s currently working on several projects for her company, her largest one at the moment is called DATA ACCESS REVITALATION PROJECT. It’s focus is on remediating direct access. Currently, everyone has access and can see the files of everyone else due to a mishap. It means there's a huge security risk as anyone can see all the files.  </p>
     <p>She is supporting the IT leadership team and head of Tech for her company. The company she works for is world wide, and it means everyone in one country, can access files in another. She is managing Asia and Australia as far as this project is concerned.  </p>
     <p>Her job is defining access for everyone. Who, what and where for everyone in the Asian and Australian side of her business. She places everyone into and Active Directory group, and gives them appropriate access to the files. This is a big deal, as people's credentials and accounts hold personal information which anyone can access at this time.  </p>

     <h3>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.  </h3>
     <p>Sarah works in the Health and Car Insurance industry, just on the security end of things. The industry in monitored by APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority). P.I.I (personal information such as name, birth, passport details) and P.C.I (Credit card information) are sources of data for the company. It is Sarah’s job to protect this data. </p>
     <p>At this point of the interview, Sarah mentioned it to be similar to what Optus “SHOULD have been doing”. This is referring to the 2022 leak that Optus had endured, where thousands of personal information or ‘data’ was stolen.  </p>

     <h3>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?  </h3>
     <p>Sarah explains that this is her only job. She does however have housekeeping tasks, such as answering emails and keeping up communication. </p>

     <h3>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.  </h3>
     <p>Stakeholders

Project managers (those in charge of the project and set tasks to the managers)<br>

Sponsors<br>

Head of Tech (A higher up who coordinates the use of technology)<br>

CAB – Change Advisory Board<br>

Project teammates (Sarah’s intermediate workmates who she works alongside to protect data. She is in regular contact with them.)<br>

Support staff<br>

DISO – Divisional Information Security Officer<br>

Manager (Sarah’s immediate manager. “She sets me tasks and I complete them.”) </p><br>

     <h3>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </h3>
     <p>Sarah actual works from home since Covid so she relies heavily on her home set up. She uses Microsoft Teams to schedule, attend and change meetings. She answers calls (both video and not), and messages all throughout the day. </p>
     <p> She says it's critical that everyone understands the scope and importance of the work. It’s important that the risks are being managed, and that the team can work fluidly with one another. </p>

     <h3> 6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? </h3>
     <p>Sarah has no interaction with clients or investors. It is not her role to. </p>

     <h3>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </h3>
     <p>Her answer was simply “Raising change requests to CAB (Change Advisory Board)." </p>
     <p> The CAB is the section in her work, who access the authorization and scheduling of changes.</p>
     <p>“Whenever in a tech space, there's always problem and you need it fixed. Say, an update on an application, you let them know everything. And within a few hours the change should be complete.” she told me.  They consider and complete the prework that there should be no impacts on others and that data insights, reports, findings, access and request approvals.  </p>
     <p>She said these are the most important aspects of her work. And take the most time because “they have to be right”.  </p>

     <h3>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?  </h3>
     <p>Simply put; “time zones”. By the time her manager opens her computer, Sarah has already attended three meetings with her American co-workers.  She feels like she ‘takes one for the team’ by doing the early shifts, but she loves her job even if at times it’s ‘too early’.  </p>

     <h3>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? </h3>
     <p>At this point, Sarah shows me her schedule, and says ‘see next weekend? We're running a scenario.’ Her work is going to trial a worst case scenario, on top of her normal workload. For example, they might ‘lose’ half of their data in a leak. The ‘game’ is to see if they can still function whilst fixing this issue. She says it’s a stressful weekend for all involved, but a necessity to see if they can still do their jobs.
She says that captures the essence of IT work, because it shows how unpredictable it is, and how people need to problem solve fast. ‘It’s also fast and messy’ she says, ‘which is exactly what this line of work is like”.    </p>

    <h3>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?  </h3>
    <p>I’m a security analyst for a large international company that deals with Health and Car insurance. I’m working on a few projects lately, but our main on is called DATA ACCESS REVITALATION PROJECT. It’s all about access. We had a mishap and now everyone has access to everyone’s files. It’s a mess. HUGE security leak, and my team and I must clean it up.  </p>

    <h3>How big is the mess? </h3>
    <p>Oh man. I’m in charge of Asia and Australia, and still have to co-ordinate with my team mates in America.  </p>

    <h3>So what exactly do you do Sarah? </h3>
    <p>I define access for everyone. I have top manually place people in groups and then define their appropriate access. It’s an important job as people’s credentials and accounts hold personal information. </p>

    <h3>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.  </h3>
    <p>I work in the Health and Car insurance industry, just on the security side of things. The industry in monitored by APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority). P.I.I (personal information such as name, birth, passport details) and P.C.I (Credit card information) are sources of data for the company. I hope I’m painting a picture of how important my job is. It’s similar to what Optus is struggling with at the moment. All that confidential data, is really, REALLY important.  </p>

    <h3>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?  </h3>
    <p>None, that’s it.  </p>

    <h3>Nothing else? What about team meetings and emails and such? </h3>
    <p>Oh yeah, housekeeping is done everyday. And I attend a lot of meetings. But my main role is just workingon the projects and following my teams lead. </p>

    <h3>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.  </h3>
    <p>Stakeholders, project managers, sponsors, head of Tech, CAB, project teammates, support staff,DISO, and my managers. </p>

    <h3>Could you elaborate on a few please? </h3>
    <p>Sure! My project manager sets tasks for MY manager. We report to our manager but the project manager is the head boss for us. My teammates are just that – teammates. Since I work from home we mainly use MS Teams to communicate to one another. Emails, short phone calls, etc. We all help each other out and try to get the tasks allocated to us finished.  </p>

    <h3>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.  </h3>
    <p>As I just said, I work from home. This means  we rely heavily on the internet. Since covid we haven’t had an office, so we’ve been focused on using the net to talk to one another. I prefer it this way personally. </p>

    <h3>What types of tools do you use? </h3>
    <p>Oh! Microsoft teams is our main communicator. We also use texting and phone calls. But MS Teams is the best since we have a history which we can go back and check, we can record meetings and it’s easy to use internationally. </p>

    <h3>Why do you prefer working from home?</h3>
    <p>The flexibility. I have a puppy and I live in the middle of Sydney so traffic sucks. At home I get the most rest, I can do yoga between calls and I can focus on me.</p>

    <h3>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?  </h3>
    <p>I have no contact with them. That isn’t within my role. </p>

    <h3>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.  </h3>
    <p>Probably change requests. </p>

    <h3>Can you elaborate?</h3>
    <p>Sure. So we raise requests to CAB (Change Advisory Board)</p>
    <p>They are the ones that authorise changes. Whenever in a tech space, there's always problem and you need it fixed. Say, an update on an application, you let them know everything. And within a few hours the change should be complete. They take the most time because you have to be specific and tell that everything’s right. </p>

    <h3>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
    <p>Time zones. I have to get up several times during the night to attend meetings based in America. Not everyday but at least monthly. I start really early in the morning and by the time my manager has logged on I’ve been to three meetings. I feel like I take one for the team, but most days it doesn’t bother me.  </p>

    <h3>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of  the IT industry?</h3>
    <p>Well next weekend we’re running a scenario, where we pretend like one of our servers are down. It’s a worst case scenario.  We have our normal workload, PLUS our problem that needs fixing. Its stressful.

It captures what IT is about, because no one day is ever the same. It’s fast and messy, and it’s exactly what this line of work is like. </p>
