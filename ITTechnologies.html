      <h1 class="font">Cloud Services Servers</h1>
       <h2 class="fonts">What does it do?</h2>


     <p>A cloud refers to a type of server that is located remotely (usually in data centres) and can be accessed via the internet. Cloud servers can provide the same processing power, storage, and applications as traditional physical servers. A cloud server is a virtual server that runs in a cloud computing environment rather than a physical server. It is built, hosted, and delivered over the internet using a cloud computing platform, such as Google Docs, and can be accessed remotely. They are also referred to as virtual servers. Cloud servers are self-contained units that contain all of the software needed to function.</p>

     <p>A third-party company that provides cloud-based platform, infrastructural facilities, application, or storage services is known as a cloud service provider. Companies must typically pay only for the number of cloud services they use, similar to how a landowner would pay for a utility such as electricity or gasoline. Cloud computing is a new way to instruct computers and advance internet use that is less time-consuming than traditional business uses of computers and the internet. Data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider's network, cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive. We can set up our own cloud infrastructure and give other users access to it. It means that your personal or official computers are accessible to your customers via HTTPS or FTPs. </p><br>

            <h2 class="fonts">Uses of cloud computing:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Making cloud-based applications.</li>
              <li>Develop and verify applications</li>
              <li>Examination of data.</li>
              <li>Store, back up and recover data.</li>
              <li>Audio and video can be streamed.</li>
              <li>Incorporate intelligence.</li>
              <li>Cloud computing is an operational technology that allows computer/smartphone/tablet users to use the internet to place, measure, assemble, manage, host, generate, post, eliminate, distribute, edit, and manipulate remotely hosted system software and applications software data and information. </li>
              <li>It is a new revenue stream for service providers through SAAS (software as a service), PAAS (platform as a service), and IAAS (infrastructure as a service) business models. (Sharma K, 2018) </li>
              </p>


      <p>Cloud computing in edication: Students can now access educational or administrative programs from their schools anytime, anyplace with high speed and accuracy due to the use of cloud computing. During software deployments, teachers and students can work together. Teachers and administration at the school can access current information on usage and applications. Observation will be simple. To gain access to the IT infrastructure and application services for students and teachers, they may be required to pay. It will lower the expense of maintaining the IT infrastructure. such as the management of apps, installations, and servers, as well as the renewal of application licenses used by students. They can grow and collaborate with other school divisions to share IT resources. Additionally, it will split the cost of operating information technology services and goods among all of the schools' branches. (Sharma K, 2018) </p>

      <p>Cloud computing in business: Cloud computing is now being pursued after by businesses of all sizes in order to maximise their chances of success. The SAAS, IAAS, and PAAS business models generate software as a service (CRM), platforms as a service (for application development), and infrastructure (server) as a service (for data management and analysis). </p>

      <p>Cloud-based IT infrastructure and applications are being supplied and developed by Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and many other large IT companies for local firms, healthcare, data centres, education, and CRM. (Sharma K, 2018) </p>

      <p>Cloud computing in healthcare: A significant amount of patient data created over the course of therapy can be stored and accessed due to cloud computing. ECG, blood pressure monitoring devices, and other medical equipment and appliances produce data that must be captured, stored, and analyzed in order to make an appropriate treatment decision. For various reasons, many persons in real-time from patients, attendants, doctors, practitioners, and management need access to the data generated by medical devices and applications. After using cloud computing, data and information may now be accessed, and managed quickly, accurately, and in real-time.(Sharma K, 2018)

  </p><br>

       <h2 class="fonts">What is the likely impact?</h2>

      <p>Collaboration: Cloud computing enables mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which, with over 2.6 billion smartphones in use worldwide today, is an excellent way to ensure that no one is ever left behind.</p>

      <p>Scalability: Cloud computing's scalability enables businesses to grow efficiently. Businesses can increase their infrastructure and facilities without having to assess server requirements or purchase additional storage capacity. (Aparna,2021) </p>

      <p>Flexibility: Clients have a lot of flexibility when it comes to cloud computing. The services can be easily tested and deployed via the cloud. The customers are free to choose which services they require and how much they are willing to pay for them. By offering a variety of services, cloud services can better meet the changing business demands.</p>

      <p>Long-Term Growth: Cloud computing also enables businesses to rapidly scale and adapt, accelerating innovation, increasing business agility, streamlining operations, and lowering costs. This will not only assist businesses in sustaining the current crisis, but it may also contribute to improved long-term growth.</p>

      <p>Convenience for Students: Students nowadays can access data from any location and at any time due to cloud computing. Students can enrol online and take part in online learning activities. Cloud computing has enabled institutions to use the storage cloud to securely store substantial amounts of data without installing a complicated and expensive infrastructure. (Sharma K, 2018) </p>

      <p>Downtime: Downtime is one of the fundamental potential disadvantages of using cloud computing. Cloud computing service providers may occasionally experience technical issues due to a variety of factors such as power outages, poor Internet access, the need for data centre maintenance, and so on. </p><br>

        <h2 class="fonts">How this will affect you</h2>

      <p>Cloud computing in our daily life: Cloud computing technologies are used by the majority of major websites and applications that consumers access via PCs (personal computers) and mobile devices. For example, the fact that you can watch HD (high definition) movies, TV shows, and live streams is because the resources you're accessing are stored on a cloud server. As a result, many video streaming websites give you the possibility of watching the same movie on server 1, server 2, and so on. (Sharma K, 2018) </p>

      <p>Google drive and OneDrive are going options for the general public and small businesses to store, access, create, and edit documents anytime, anywhere. The use of cloud computing and cloud storage helps and benefits them to reduce the cost of data management, improve productivity, and safety & security of data and information and personally Since I and my family were unable to attend my brother's wedding back in 2020 because it was held abroad (During a pandemic) and with the help of Google docs, all of the photos, movies, and Facebook live videos were preserved in one document that all of my relatives from anywhere around the world could access at any time and enjoy. (Sharma K, 2018) </p>

      <p>Secure applications are required for social media, video calls, broadcasting, and live video streaming. fast servers that could function without a hitch at whatever time a user wanted to use the tool. Additionally, live streaming, HD video calling, fast servers, and cloud computing encourage people to go live rather than just post photographs on social media sites. (Sharma K, 2018) </p>

      <p>Businesses can use cloud computing to control their resources online. It enables businesses to access their information virtually, allowing data to be accessed at any time and from any location. Cloud computing is gaining popularity among businesses. </p>

      <p>As with any other IT system, the cloud is susceptible to technical issues such as reboots, network outages, and downtime. These events have the potential to disrupt business operations and processes, as well as cause financial harm to us or any other company</p><br>

        <h2 class="fonts">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>In conclusion, cloud computing is a recent development technology that we do not need to purchase because it is free, easily accessible from anywhere, and has many benefits and impacts (both good and bad) that are entirely dependent on the user.</p><br>

        <h1 class="font">Cybersecurity</h1>
        <h2 class="fonts">What does it do?</h2>

    <p>Cyber Security is fast becoming an everyday word for individuals and business alike, it is often that we are seeing security breaches happening in major businesses broadcasted by the news. This writing is detailing what Cyber Security is, how it’s used in the current day, what we can expect to see in the future and who will be affected by these advancements.</p>

    <p>Successful Cyber Security, according to (Cisco 2022), is multilayered protection that covers all the devices, networks, programs and the data that needs requires safeguarding. Currently, it is not only major companies that require a heavy level of protection as basically anyone who is on the internet is a potential target from malicious attacks. As technology advances so do the threats one is venerable to in cyberspace. These threats include ‘Phishing, Ransomware, Malware and social engineering’ (Cisco 2022).</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">2FA and MFA</h2>

    <p>Cyber Security has come a long way from the days of simply having a username and password login to keep you safe. In recent years, advancements in security have seen steps introduced such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA), or Multi-Factor Authentication. Though MFA is an added layer of security, it is only as secure as the selected authentication technique/s (Incognia 2022). For example, requiring a password then the need to generate a one-time password is not as strong of a method as it would be if Face ID authentication was also introduced. When it comes to 2FA, technologies such as location behaviour, biometrics, authentication apps, text, email or security key authentications create a stronger level of security (Incognia 2022; Tech Republic 2022). These security features are commonly used on things such as email, online banking, crypto wallets or different software programs.</p><br>

        <h2 class="fonts">AES Encryption</h2>

    <p> Advancements in technology have seen a higher level of personal security required, using technologies such as encryption. Using the same password for every account you have on the internet is considered unsafe for obvious reasons. Security companies offer encrypted applications for passwords and sensitive information. For example, Norton Password Manager or Apples iCloud Keychain, which are applications that use AES 256-bit encryption to safely store all your usernames and passwords along with any other sensitive information you wish to safeguard. Advanced Encryption System (AES) is currently the highest level of encryption available and is used the world over, from private all the way up to governments sectors (Idera 2022). The algorithm used for ASE offers 128-bit block encryption that is symmetric, which means, the encryption and decryption use the same key both to lock and unlock. At first glance that doesn’t sound safe, though according to (Idera 2022) 128-bit, let alone 256-bit, has still never been decrypted and would take several years to work out all the possible combinations, so it is unlikely to happen any time soon.
    </p><br>

        <h2 class="fonts">Public key Cryptography</h2>

    <p>Commonly used in Block chain applications is an encryption known as Public Key Cryptography or asymmetric encryption (IBM 2022). This is ‘based on algorithms presented by Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) Data Security’. RSA differs from AES Encryption as one of the keys is public and the other is kept private. The only way the encrypted data from the public key can be decrypted is with the matching private key (IBM 2022). The Creation of digital wallets and signing transactions are the aspects of cryptocurrency that operate using blockchain technology (Sharma T K 2022). These are the main areas that require the use of Public Key Cryptography to ensure a high level of security. The key that is kept public generates a hash function which then creates a public address, this is what serves as a location to send and receive crypto currencies (Sharma T K 2022). The private key, like the name implies, remains private. The private key is what is used to legitimize the operation by signing off on the digital transaction.
    </p><br>

       <h2 class="fonts">Artificial intelligence</h2>

    <p>With the growth and speed of development in IT, it’s clear that that Ai is going to play a huge role in Cyber Security in the future. (Saxe J 2022) stated in an article that, Ai is transforming Cyber Security by way of identifying network abnormalities instinctively, as well as determining the best security safeguards are implemented. A decent proportion of cyber security responsibilities are increasingly being relied upon by Ai, due to its ability to process and operate at speeds above that of human capability. Though Ai will certainly become necessary in the future, Artificial Intelligence is still in its early development and there are many areas that need to be improved upon before its true ability can be realised (Cloudtech24 2022).
    </p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">What is the likely impact?</h2>

    <p>The potential impact of the recent advancements in cyber security will be great, although as the world continues to move further into cyberspace, it becomes clear that the measures stated above are necessary to ensure that the shift into digital is done in a manner that is not only convenient and efficient for all users, but also ensures the highest level of safety. As cyber security defences increase, simultaneously do the threats against it. With these advancing threats the basic understanding of what Cyber Security is and means to the private user, and most certainly also in business, will be lifted to a point that would have been considered advanced knowledge at a point not so far in the past.
    </p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">What is likely to change?</h2>

    <p>Some of the changes we can expect to see in cyber security in the future are found in areas such as, zero trust, ransomware and attacks, mobile device security, cloud security and IoT security.</p>

    <p>‘Zero-trust network architecture (ZTNA)’ is commonly found in Cloud networks and is explained basically by the network not completely trusting any operation that is happening within it, unlike traditional security systems (Sarkar S et al. 2022).
    Zero-Trust uses behavioural patterns to determine trust and forecast potential threats. This method increases security, and it is likely to be more commonly used in the future (Sarkar S et al. 2022).</p>

    <p>Technology developments in the future could potentially see use Deepfake Ransomware. Deepfakes take media such as images, video and audio and manipulates them in an attempt to pass as the target person. There is potential for attackers use deepfakes to create fake content that could incriminate or embarrass a person, this then would be used to hold them at ransom. As deepfakes are constantly advancing, with the ability to determine real from fake becoming increasingly difficult, along with the use of social media to quickly widespread the fake media, it is likely that deepfakes will be an attractive tool for attackers to use. With this issue as a potential for the future ransomware's best defender, machine learning, will possibly have to play catch up (Beaman C et al. 2021).</p>

    <p>As more companies adopt bring your own device (BYOD) policies, understanding which apps employees use is becoming more integral for the security of the companies in in which they work for. Systems such as Mobile Device Management (MDM) is increasingly being used to ensure security is maintained in employee's personal devices (Beaman C et al. 2020).</p>

    <p>When it comes to IoT security, blockchain could have multiple uses in the future. It could allow for registering the behaviours of devices, which would allow for security observation. Another benefit of behaviour registering would be that the issue of system resources is even over a period (Mohan S et al. 2018).</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Which people will be most affected?</h2>

    <p>It seems likely that it will be business first that will notice the effect of these changes, though before long the roll-on effect will come over to the private sector as well. A reason for this being, there is more money in business compared to private users. With that said, with more money potentially available to attackers also comes a higher available level of security. Technology will always continue to progress and so will threats to cyber security. This will continue to give opportunity for new jobs to be created as the technology builds upon what is already done by people.</p>

    <p>Some of the ways that people will notice the effect of advancements in cyber security as well as its threats will likely be realised through our employment by way of training. It will continue to become more important for employees to understand their role in the security of the company they work for as they are increasingly targeted by threats such as phishing email, phone calls and social engineering (Williams E J et al.). Alternatively, private business owners will find that they need to increase their knowledge of such areas as well purely out of necessity. Hopefully that happens proactively rather than reactively, though both are likely to occur. Younger generations naturally will express the importance of basic security checks, such as software updates, to older generations. Though as well its noticeable, especially recently, that cyber-crimes are rapidly becoming more common and are becoming regular occurrences on national news networks. Overall, there will be a lifted level of skill when it comes to cyber security.

       <h1 class="font">Machine Learning</h1>

    <p>In today's world, due to technological advancements, machine learning is possible because everything is online. This generates a vast amount of data, which is a key to the analysis. ML technology mainly uses in business for predictive analysis, knowledge extraction, Image recognition, behavioural analysis, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the memory handling capabilities of computers have increased, which helps them to process a considerable amount of data without delay. Moreover, computers have great competent powers. ML technology is used in many sectors such as health care, fraud detection, transportation, e-commerce, gaming, chatbots etc.</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">What is Machine Learning?</h2>

    <p>Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence, and it uses different self-learning algorithms that derive knowledge from data to predict outcomes. In other words, computers can also learn from past experiences like humans. However, for computers, experiences are just data for them (Simplilearn 2022).   There are ways in which machines can learn. Such as:</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Supervised learning</h2>

    <p>This is where the machine learns under guidance. It means explicitly training the machine, what is an input and what is an output. This is done through feeding the machine learning algorithms (Simplilearn 2022). </p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Unsupervised Learning</h2>

    <p>Independently done by the machine, through learning unlabelled data. The trained models learn from the data, discover the patterns and features, and return the output (Simplilearn 2022).</p>

    <p>Many innovations have been accomplished in machine learning, taking the advancements to new heights. This includes:</p>

      <h2 class="fonts">Computer vision</h2>

    <p>Computer vision is part of AI and involves identifying objects in images and videos. With the advancement of ML, the error rate has now lowered to just 3%. Besides the better accuracy, there would be time-saving in performing some tasks. For instance, it would not be possible to classify the 100,000 pictures of dogs in a few minutes, but computer vision has great potential, and its uses in the medical field and airport security. (The 365 team. 2022)</p>

      <h2 class="fonts">Focused Personalization</h2>

    <p>The latest ML advancement involves knowing target markets and their preferences. Hence, the increased accuracy of a model in businesses can measure their products and services based on exact needs using recommender systems and algorithms. Ever considered how Netflix recommends the shows and Spotify plays your favourite songs? Machine learning is behind all these evolutions. (The 365 team. 2022) </p>

      <h2 class="fonts">Improved internet search</h2>

    <p>Machine learning enhances the performance and results of the search engine by analysing past data. Google algorithms continue learning and getting better at returning relevant results with many google searches that have been registered. Google search is one of the ML development these days. (The 365 team. 2022)</p>

      <h2 class="fonts">Chatbots</h2>

    <p>Chatbot technologies are an ongoing business trend globally, enhancing customer support and marketing. (The 365 team. 2022)</p>

      <h2 class="fonts">Transportation system</h2>

    <p>Over recent years, we have all experienced and been amazed by the developments in the transportation system. All these are possible through machine learning technology. This technique explores the crashes, traffic, environmental aspects, intricate relations of road, and so on. (The 365 team. 2022)

    Moreover, many aviation and logistic companies are adopting this tech to increase efficiency, safety, and accuracy of arrival time.</p>

    <p>Shortly, Quantum computing can define machine learning. Machine learning has been transformed and innovated by quantum algorithms. Quantum computing allows multi-state operations simultaneously, enabling faster data processing. Moreover, the well-designed quantum processor to enhance ML capabilities will certainly boost the development of an all-purpose model to perform tasks in various domains simultaneously. In addition, there would be an innovative leap in RL to help us to deal with unforeseen circumstances. Reinforcement learning can truly leverage data to maximize rewards, so we expect to see several breakthroughs in industries like astronomy, biology, and economics.</p><br>

       <h2 class="fonts">What is the likely impact?</h2>

    <p>Machine learning is transforming the world in many fields, including healthcare services, agriculture, education, transport, food, banks, entertainment, etc. Technologies like IoT and cloud computing are all growing implementations of ML. ML offers potential value to companies trying to leverage big data for customer satisfaction. Although ML technology has impacted the workforce is impressive. There would be expecting changes in some fields, such as:</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Health care</h2>

    <p>Health care: It simplifies administrative methodologies in hospitals and medical treatments and treats infectious diseases. It can affect hospitals and health systems in enhancing efficiency while lowering the value of care. This technology in the medical field will not wholly substitute humans.</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Agriculture</h2>

    <p>Agriculture: ML technology assures that the crop is top-quality and takes less time. The ML algorithms check soil conditions and predict the quality of products. It can cut labour by doing all the fieldwork itself.</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Robotics</h2>

    <p>Robotics: A machine learning algorithm is used in designing the software of the robots. Using AI in hospitals, Age care, Military, hotels, restaurants, airports, and retail for customer interaction can cut the labour force of humans.</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Automative Industry</h2>

    <p>Automotive Industry: The car manufacturers are working on creating the fully autonomous vehicle. Machine learning is one of the leading technologies that can help to turn this innovation into reality.</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">Manufacturing sector</h2>

    <p>Manufacturing sector: Adopting ML technology for business operations can reduce costs, improve quality control, and enhance supply chain management. The future of employment will be at risk as ML can do more complex tasks efficiently than humans. All the jobs will be taken by the algorithm and replaced with machines and automation software. With this technology, some industries have already started reducing human intervention. However, in the next few years, some jobs will disappear, such as drivers, customer service jobs, cashiers, accountants, bookkeepers, bank tellers, financial advisers, farmers, manufacturing workers, dispatchers, servers, construction workers, movie stars and more. Instead of eliminating the need for human labour, ML disruptions will redirect job demand. However, people will have to retrain and learn new skills in their jobs.</p><br>

      <h2 class="fonts">How this will affect you?</h2>

    <p>The world would be amazing with the future innovation of ML technology. Every aspect of life would be digitalized, from smart homes to education.  On the one hand, Robots will do all the tasks for humans, especially for older people; that is unrealistic. I am sure that the innovation of this ML technology releases from household work in terms of relieving stress and saving time. I assume that I can be independent even later in my life span as this development in improved elderly care and driverless cars. In addition, as it diagnoses diseases more accurately and faster, more lives could be saved, and it will also impact our life span.</p><br>

    <p>On the other hand, this technology affects our livelihood. All businesses are moving towards this technology, so there would be a job threat for all of us. Currently, I am working as a grocery manager. My job role will be taken by this technology soon. So, I am in a place where it is time to upgrade new skills to secure future employment. I am concerned about how some of my family members will face this technological revolution because they do labour-hand jobs and are aged and uneducated. So, there would be a need for learning and upgrading new skills to find future employment. Nevertheless, there is some concern about how people over age 55 can learn these new skills.</p><br>

    <h1 class="font">Autonomous Cars</h1>
    <h2 class="fonts">What does it do?</h2>

    <p>An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that does not need any external input from a user in order to carry out its normal duties. Now there aren’t just autonomous and non-autonomous vehicle, there are six level of automation existing today. Level 0 – 2 primarily controlled by a human user whereas 3 – 5 is controlled by the system put in place. (Synopsys 2022) elaborates on the six levels of autonomy.</p>

    <p><b>0</b> - Complete manual control of the vehicle with minor features</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Auto emergency brakes</li>
          <li>Blind spot warning</li>
          <li>Lane detection</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>1</b> - Driver assistance providing braking, acceleration OR steering support</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cruise control or,</li>
            <li>Lane assist</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>2</b> - Partial Automation which has both steering AND brakes / acceleration</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lane assist AND cruise control</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>3</b> - Conditional automation, vehicle can detect environment, requires conditions to be driver-less, human input still required</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traffic jam assist (follows vehicle in front up to 60km/h and adjusts accordingly)</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>4</b> - High automation, all driving tasks are performed by the vehicle under specific circumstances. Interaction from the human is optional.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Driverless taxis</li>
          <li>Pedals / steering wheel optional</li>
          <li>Still requires conditions be met to be completely driverless</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>5</b> - Full automation, the vehicle performs all driving tasks, no human intervention is required.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Level 4 but does not need conditions</li><br>

    <p>According to (Parekh et al. 2022) the following table displays what will be fitted to a vehicle for it to be autonomous.</p>

    <table bgcolor="b8b8b8" width="700">
        <tr>
        <th colspan="2"><h2>Technology used</h2></th>
        </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Cameras / Infrared</b></td>
        <td>There will be standard cameras set up all over the vehicle to give it an all round view of it’s environment. Infrared detect and convert heat signatures of the environment it is viewing into an image. Within the infrared camera is an optical system that channels heat energy into a sensor array that is made up of thousands of small detector pixels configured in a grid (Fluke 2022). Infrared will be valuable in autonomous vehicle for low light situations such as tunnels, night-time. Although infrared is severely limited with occurrences such as fog, RADAR will be fitted to the vehicle to help with this issue as it’s signals can cut through fog.</td>
