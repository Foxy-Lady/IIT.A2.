<!--Need some headings for clouds and services-->

<!--below is the paragraphs for clouds and services-->
     <p>A cloud is a type of server, which is remote (usually in data centres) means we can access it via the internet. Cloud servers can perform all the same functions as a traditional physical server, delivering processing power, storage and applications. A cloud server is a virtual server (rather than a physical server) running in a cloud computing environment. It is built, hosted and delivered via a cloud computing platform via the internet for example: (google docs) and can be accessed remotely. They are also known as virtual servers. Cloud servers have all the software they require to run and can function as independent units.</p><br>

     <p>A cloud service provider is a third-party company offering a cloud-based platform, infrastructure, application, or storage services. Much like a homeowner would pay for a utility such as electricity or petrol, companies typically must pay only for the number of cloud services they use, as business demands require. Cloud computing is a new way to instruct computers and advance the use of the internet and is less time-consuming than traditional uses of computers and the internet for business.</p><br>

     <p>Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network. We can set up our own cloud infrastructure and provide access to other users. It means your personal computer or official computers are accessible to your customers by HTTPS or FTPs.</p><br>

<!--Im not sure how to put this next paragraph into dot points (clouds and services)-->
     <p>Uses of cloud computing:

Create cloud-native applications.

Test and build applications

Analyse data.

Store, back up and recover data.

Stream audio and video.

Embed intelligence.

For users, cloud computing is an operational technology in which computer/smartphones/tablet users can store, calculate, arrange, manage, host, create, publish, remove, share, edit and manipulate remotely hosted system software and applications software’s data and information by using the internet.

For service providers: it is a new stream of generating revenue from the same product through SAAS (software as a service), PAAS (platform as a service), and IAAS (infrastructure as a service) business models.</p><br>

      <p>Cloud computing in education: Students can now access educational or administrative programs from their schools anytime, anyplace with high speed and accuracy due to the use of cloud computing. During software deployments, teachers and students can work together. Teachers and administration at the school can access current information on usage and applications. Observation will be simple. To gain access to the IT infrastructure and application services for students and teachers, they may be required to pay. It will lower the expense of maintaining the IT infrastructure. such as the management of apps, installations, and servers, as well as the renewal of application licenses used by students. They can grow and collaborate with other school divisions to share IT resources. Additionally, it will split the cost of operating information technology services and goods among all of the schools' branches.</p><br>

      <p>Cloud computing in business: Now businesses of all sizes looking for cloud computing to maximize their success opportunities. The SAAS, IAAS, and PAAS business models are producing software as a service such as CRM, Platforms as services for application development, and infrastructure (server) as a service for data management and analysis.</p><br>

      <p>Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and many other big IT companies are supplying and developing cloud-based IT infrastructure and applications for small businesses, healthcare, data centres, education, and CRM.</p><br>

      <p>Cloud computing in healthcare: A significant amount of patient data created over the course of therapy can be stored and accessed due to cloud computing. ECG, blood pressure monitoring devices, and other medical equipment and appliances produce data that must be captured, stored, and analyzed in order to make an appropriate treatment decision. For various reasons, many persons in real-time from patients, attendants, doctors, practitioners, and management need access to the data generated by medical devices and applications. After using cloud computing, data and information may now be accessed, and managed quickly, accurately, and in real-time.</p><br>

      <!--need a heading for what is the likley impact-->

      <p>Collaboration: Cloud computing enables mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which, with over 2.6 billion smartphones in use worldwide today, is an excellent way to ensure that no one is ever left behind.</p><br>

      <p>Scalability: The scalability of cloud computing enables businesses to grow efficiently. Companies can expand their infrastructure and facilities as they develop without having to assess server needs or purchase additional storage capacity.</p><br>

      <p>Flexibility: Clients have a lot of flexibility when it comes to cloud computing. The services can be easily tested and deployed via the cloud. The customers are free to choose which services they require and how much they are willing to pay for them. By offering a variety of services, cloud services can better meet the changing business demands.</p><br>

      <p>Long-Term Growth: Cloud computing also enables businesses to rapidly scale and adapt, accelerating innovation, increasing business agility, streamlining operations, and lowering costs. This will not only assist businesses in sustaining the current crisis, but it may also contribute to improved long-term growth.</p><br>

      <p>Convenience for Students: Students nowadays can access data from any location and at any time due to cloud computing. Students can enrol online and take part in online learning activities. Cloud computing has enabled institutions to use the storage cloud to securely store substantial amounts of data without installing a complicated and expensive infrastructure.</p><br>

      <p>Downtime: One of the primary potential drawbacks of using cloud computing is downtime. Cloud computing service providers may occasionally experience technical issues that might occur for a variety of reasons, including power outages, poor Internet access, the requirement for maintenance at data centres, etc.</p><br>

      <!--need a table for advantages and disadvantages-->

      <!--need a heading for how will this affect you?-->

      <p>Cloud computing in our daily life: The majority of major websites and applications that consumers access on PCs (personal computer) and mobile devices employee (hosted) cloud computing technologies. For instance, the reason you can watch movies, TV shows, and live streams in HD (high definition) quality is that the resources you're accessing are stored on a cloud server. In response to this, many websites that stream videos provide you with the choice to watch the same movie on server 1, server 2 and so on.</p><br>

      <p>Google drive and OneDrive are going options for the general public and small businesses to store, access, create, and edit documents anytime, anywhere. The use of cloud computing and cloud storage helps and benefits them to reduce the cost of data management, improve productivity, and safety & security of data and information and personally Since I and my family were unable to attend my brother's wedding back in 2020 because it was held abroad (during a pandemic) and with the help of Google docs, all of the photos, movies, and Facebook live videos were preserved in one document that all of my relatives from anywhere around the world could access at any time and enjoy.</p><br>

      <p>Social media, video calls, broadcasting, and live video streaming all required secure applications and fast servers that could function without a hitch at whatever time a user wanted to use the tool. Additionally, live streaming, HD video calling, fast servers, and cloud computing encourage people to go live rather than just post photographs on social media sites.</p><br>

      <p>Cloud computing provides a way for businesses to manage their resources online. It allows the business entities to access their information virtually, whereby, data can be accessed anytime and anywhere. More and more companies are moving towards cloud computing.</p><br>

      <p>The cloud, like any other IT system, is likely to be exposed to technical issues such as reboots, network outages, and downtime. These occurrences can disrupt business operations and processes and cause financial harm to us or any company.</p><br>

      <!--need a heading for conclusion-->

      <p>In conclusion, cloud computing is a recent development technology that we do not need to purchase because it is free, easily accessible from anywhere, and has many benefits and impacts (both good and bad) that are entirely dependent on the user.</p><br>

      <!--need a heading for Cyber Secuirty-->

    <p>Cyber Security is fast becoming an everyday word for individuals and business alike, it is often that we are seeing security breaches happening in major businesses broadcasted by the news. This writing is detailing what Cyber Security is, how it’s used in the current day, what we can expect to see in the future and who will be affected by these advancements.</p><br>

    <p>Successful Cyber Security, according to (Cisco 2022), is multilayered protection that covers all the devices, networks, programs and the data that needs requires safeguarding. Currently, it is not only major companies that require a heavy level of protection as basically anyone who is on the internet is a potential target from malicious attacks. As technology advances so do the threats one is venerable to in cyberspace. These threats include ‘Phishing, Ransomware, Malware and social engineering’ (Cisco 2022).</p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for 2FA & MFA-->

    <p>Cyber Security has come a long way from the days of simply having a username and password login to keep you safe. In recent years, advancements in security have seen steps introduced such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA), or Multi-Factor Authentication. Though MFA is an added layer of security, it is only as secure as the selected authentication technique/s (Incognia 2022). For example, requiring a password then the need to generate a one-time password is not as strong of a method as it would be if Face ID authentication was also introduced. When it comes to 2FA, technologies such as location behaviour, biometrics, authentication apps, text, email or security key authentications create a stronger level of security (Incognia 2022; Tech Republic 2022). These security features are commonly used on things such as email, online banking, crypto wallets or different software programs.</p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for AES Encryption-->

    <p> Advancements in technology have seen a higher level of personal security required, using technologies such as encryption. Using the same password for every account you have on the internet is considered unsafe for obvious reasons. Security companies offer encrypted applications for passwords and sensitive information. For example, Norton Password Manager or Apples iCloud Keychain, which are applications that use AES 256-bit encryption to safely store all your usernames and passwords along with any other sensitive information you wish to safeguard. Advanced Encryption System (AES) is currently the highest level of encryption available and is used the world over, from private all the way up to governments sectors (Idera 2022). The algorithm used for ASE offers 128-bit block encryption that is symmetric, which means, the encryption and decryption use the same key both to lock and unlock. At first glance that doesn’t sound safe, though according to (Idera 2022) 128-bit, let alone 256-bit, has still never been decrypted and would take several years to work out all the possible combinations, so it is unlikely to happen any time soon.
    </p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for Public Key Cryptography-->

    <p>Commonly used in Block chain applications is an encryption known as Public Key Cryptography or asymmetric encryption (IBM 2022). This is ‘based on algorithms presented by Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) Data Security’. RSA differs from AES Encryption as one of the keys is public and the other is kept private. The only way the encrypted data from the public key can be decrypted is with the matching private key (IBM 2022). The Creation of digital wallets and signing transactions are the aspects of cryptocurrency that operate using blockchain technology (Sharma T K 2022). These are the main areas that require the use of Public Key Cryptography to ensure a high level of security. The key that is kept public generates a hash function which then creates a public address, this is what serves as a location to send and receive crypto currencies (Sharma T K 2022). The private key, like the name implies, remains private. The private key is what is used to legitimize the operation by signing off on the digital transaction.
    </p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for Artificial intelligence-->

    <p>With the growth and speed of development in IT, it’s clear that that Ai is going to play a huge role in Cyber Security in the future. (Saxe J 2022) stated in an article that, Ai is transforming Cyber Security by way of identifying network abnormalities instinctively, as well as determining the best security safeguards are implemented. A decent proportion of cyber security responsibilities are increasingly being relied upon by Ai, due to its ability to process and operate at speeds above that of human capability. Though Ai will certainly become necessary in the future, Artificial Intelligence is still in its early development and there are many areas that need to be improved upon before its true ability can be realised (Cloudtech24 2022).
    </p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for what is the likley impact?-->

    <p>The potential impact of the recent advancements in cyber security will be great, although as the world continues to move further into cyberspace, it becomes clear that the measures stated above are necessary to ensure that the shift into digital is done in a manner that is not only convenient and efficient for all users, but also ensures the highest level of safety. As cyber security defences increase, simultaneously do the threats against it. With these advancing threats the basic understanding of what Cyber Security is and means to the private user, and most certainly also in business, will be lifted to a point that would have been considered advanced knowledge at a point not so far in the past.
    </p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for what is likley to change?-->

    <p>Some of the changes we can expect to see in cyber security in the future are found in areas such as, zero trust, ransomware and attacks, mobile device security, cloud security and IoT security.</p><br>

    <p>‘Zero-trust network architecture (ZTNA)’ is commonly found in Cloud networks and is explained basically by the network not completely trusting any operation that is happening within it, unlike traditional security systems (Sarkar S et al. 2022).
    Zero-Trust uses behavioural patterns to determine trust and forecast potential threats. This method increases security, and it is likely to be more commonly used in the future (Sarkar S et al. 2022).</p><br>

    <p>Technology developments in the future could potentially see use Deepfake Ransomware. Deepfakes take media such as images, video and audio and manipulates them in an attempt to pass as the target person. There is potential for attackers use deepfakes to create fake content that could incriminate or embarrass a person, this then would be used to hold them at ransom. As deepfakes are constantly advancing, with the ability to determine real from fake becoming increasingly difficult, along with the use of social media to quickly widespread the fake media, it is likely that deepfakes will be an attractive tool for attackers to use. With this issue as a potential for the future ransomware's best defender, machine learning, will possibly have to play catch up (Beaman C et al. 2021).</p><br>

    <p>As more companies adopt bring your own device (BYOD) policies, understanding which apps employees use is becoming more integral for the security of the companies in in which they work for. Systems such as Mobile Device Management (MDM) is increasingly being used to ensure security is maintained in employee's personal devices (Beaman C et al. 2020).</p><br>

    <p>When it comes to IoT security, blockchain could have multiple uses in the future. It could allow for registering the behaviours of devices, which would allow for security observation. Another benefit of behaviour registering would be that the issue of system resources is even over a period (Mohan S et al. 2018).</p><br>

    <!--need a sub heading for which people will be most affected?-->

    <p>It seems likely that it will be business first that will notice the effect of these changes, though before long the roll-on effect will come over to the private sector as well. A reason for this being, there is more money in business compared to private users. With that said, with more money potentially available to attackers also comes a higher available level of security. Technology will always continue to progress and so will threats to cyber security. This will continue to give opportunity for new jobs to be created as the technology builds upon what is already done by people.</p><br>

    <p>Some of the ways that people will notice the effect of advancements in cyber security as well as its threats will likely be realised through our employment by way of training. It will continue to become more important for employees to understand their role in the security of the company they work for as they are increasingly targeted by threats such as phishing email, phone calls and social engineering (Williams E J et al.). Alternatively, private business owners will find that they need to increase their knowledge of such areas as well purely out of necessity. Hopefully that happens proactively rather than reactively, though both are likely to occur. Younger generations naturally will express the importance of basic security checks, such as software updates, to older generations. Though as well its noticeable, especially recently, that cyber-crimes are rapidly becoming more common and are becoming regular occurrences on national news networks. Overall, there will be a lifted level of skill when it comes to cyber security.
